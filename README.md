# SPM Flipside Pit Randomizer Mod
This mod randomizes the contents of the Flipside Pit of 100 Trials and adds a multitude of new features and balance changes.

Install this mod as you would any other Riivolution mod on console or Dolphin; download can be found [here.](https://github.com/shiken-yme/spm-pit-randomizer/releases) Please do not enable any more than one SPM mod at one time, as they are not cross-compatible.

For Console (Wii or vWii): extract the contents of the ZIP to the root of your SD card and boot up Riivolution.

For Dolphin: find your Riivolution folder (you can find this by right-clicking your game, clicking *Start with Riivolution Patches*, then *Open Riivolution XML*; this will open the directory you need to be in), then drag and drop the contents of the ZIP to that folder. Close the folder and right-click, select *Start with Riivolution Patches*, then enable the mod.

If you run the game on Dolphin, be sure to add/enable the REL Loader Gecko code for your game version before running the game with Riivolution patches. You can find the codes [here.](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-rel-loader/tree/master/spm-rel-loader/loader)

## Features
* Randomizes spawn/exit doors & room layouts while (ideally) never creating any areas that are impossible to access without glitches
* Randomizes enemy configurations, with relative difficulty scaling per 25 floors
* Randomizes chest loot in Floors 10/20/etc., with the weight of more valuable items scaling with Pit progress
* Changes some enemy stats (mostly nerfs)
* Reskins some Dark enemies to become new enemy variants & adds previously unused enemies to the Pit, all of which are given a number of stat changes
* Overhauls Flimm's inventory, adding many recipes and Catch Cards
* Changes the final boss of the Flipside Pit and gives the player new loot
* Changes a small amount of dialogue
* Removes the Flopside Pit (for now...)

## Planned Features
* Option to have custom music by Tater-Tot Tunes play in the Flipside Pit
* "Blessing/curse" system, unsure of the details yet
* Add new enemies and modify some enemy AI to be more distinct/difficult
* Make the Flopside Pit a roguelike, with difficulty and rewards scaling with the player's level
* Many more things that don't immediately come to mind!

## Known Issues (Will be patched in a future update)
* Muths can spawn directly below the player when entering a room, causing instant unavoidable damage
* Tattles and catch card descriptions are usually quite inaccurate
* Many more things that I'm not thinking of
