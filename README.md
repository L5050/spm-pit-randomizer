# SPM Flipside Pit Randomizer Mod
This mod randomizes the contents of the Flipside Pit of 100 Trials and adds a multitude of new features and balance changes.

You may install this mod as you would any other Riivolution mod on console or Dolphin; the download can be found [here.](https://github.com/shiken-yme/spm-pit-randomizer/releases)

You may also install the mod through L5050's Flipside Mod Manager (FliMM), which can be found [here.](https://github.com/L5050/Flipside-Mod-Manager) This is highly recommended for playing mods on console, because SPM mods loaded through Riivolution may crash upon resetting the game. This is an issue that is not within my control, unfortunately.

Please do not enable any more than one SPM mod at one time, as they are not cross-compatible.

### For Console (Wii or vWii):
- If you have a legally-obtained ISO/WBFS rip of the game & a modded Wii/Wii U, you can use [Flipside Mod Manager](https://github.com/L5050/Flipside-Mod-Manager) to directly patch the game and then use your favorite USB Loader to load the game (I recommend using [Wii Backup Manager](https://wiibackupmanager.co.uk/WiiBackupManager_Build78.html) to load your game onto your console).
- Be sure to enable Gecko Codes on your USB Loader and include the REL Loader GCT for your version; instructions for how to do this can be found [here.](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-practice-codes/blob/main/INSTALLING.md#console-with-usb-loader-and-patched-iso)

**ALTERNATIVELY,** you may load the mod through Riivolution. Download the ZIP for your version in Releases, then drag & drop the contents of the ZIP to the root of your SD card, insert the SD card into your console, and boot up Riivolution. (To be clear, you want the "PitRando" and "riivolution" folders on the root of your SD card.)

### For Dolphin:
- Find your Riivolution folder (you can find this by right-clicking your game, clicking *Start with Riivolution Patches*, then *Open Riivolution XML*; this will open the directory you need to be in), then drag and drop the contents of the ZIP to that folder (this means a "riivolution" and "PitRando" folder. Close the folder and right-click, select *Start with Riivolution Patches*, then enable the mod.
- Be sure to add/enable the REL Loader Gecko code for your game version before running the game with Riivolution patches. You can find the codes [here.](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-rel-loader/tree/master/spm-rel-loader/loader)

## Features
* Quite honestly, there are just too many to list out here. The entire Pit experience has been transformed - see for yourself!

## Planned Features
* Add more roguelike features to the Flipside Pit to completely change the way you play and strategize
* Make the Flopside Pit an infinite version of the Flipside Pit
* Make the Pit generation process seeded
* Many many more things :)

## Known Issues (Will be patched in a future update)
* Tattles and Catch Card descriptions are mostly unfinished (although all of the enemy names should be accurate now!), and some ATK/DEF related details may be inaccurate.
* Strange behavior may occur on Hard Difficulty when a shell hits certain enemies or projectiles.
* Almost certainly a whole lot more I'm not thinking of or don't know about. Please report bugs to me in the [SPM Speedrunning community's](https://discord.gg/nvDAWG6fat) #modding channel! Keep in mind that some behavior may just be vanilla, so please only report bugs that seem specifically related to this mod.

This is my first ever mod, and I could not have created it or learned nearly as much as I have without all of you. Thank you all so much. Please enjoy the mod!
